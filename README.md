# registration_automation
I decided to automate the course registration process on our university website. I used Python and Selenium to automate
login, course selection, search and registration processes. It uses chromedriver to open a new window in Chrome, then
login and password are entered, then the program searches the course by course code and presses the search button.
After that program select a course, add it to the courses and register for the course.
